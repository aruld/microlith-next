title: Next.js fun!
date: 2021/01/09

I have been wanting to learn modern web frameworks for quite some time. With the recent [announcement](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) of React Server Components, the timing couldn't be better as I have decent experience on all things server-side.

I have heard great things about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and started looking into it. Last week, I ran into this [project](https://github.com/zslabs/zslabs-next) from [Zach](https://twitter.com/zslabs) who revamped his [website](https://zslabs.com/) using Next.js. I got sucked into his simplistic design elements and implementation stack.

It took me a weekend to get all this setup, which is amazing. I have hosted my blogs in wordpress, hosting this website in Vercel is amazing, which makes deployments breeze, git commit triggers a new deployment, that simple! and their tooling is impressive.

Production build just under 17 seconds!
