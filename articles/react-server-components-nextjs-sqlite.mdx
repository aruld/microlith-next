title: React server components using Next.js and Prisma
date: 2021/01/31

[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next-server-components) has ported the react server components [demo](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) using redis as its backend store.
[Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/server-components-demo) has its own port of the react server components demo which uses SQLite.

In this post, I will show how to use Prisma to abstract database queries using its built in support for SQLite in a Next.js app.

To add Primsa to your Next.js project, run these commands in project's root directory.

1. install Prisma CLI to your project:
  ```
  npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
  ```
  This should update your package.json **devDependencies** section
  ```json
    "devDependencies": {
    ...  
    "@prisma/cli": "2.15.0",
    ...
  }
  ```

2. initialize your Prisma setup with the following command:
  ```
  npx prisma init
  ```

  This will generate a prisma folder which has your schema definition and migrations.
  Create a dev.db file in this folder, this will be our sqlite database.
  
  SQLite does not support date, so will be storing **updated_at** as a String type.

  ```js filename=schema.prisma
  datasource db {
    provider = "sqlite"
    url      = "file:./dev.db"
  }

  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }

  model Note {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    title String?
    body String?
    updated_at String
    created_by String
  }
  ```

3. install Prisma client to your project:
  ```
  npm install @prisma/client
  ```

  This should update your package.json **dependencies** section
  ```json
    "dependencies": {
    ...  
    "@prisma/client": "2.15.0",
    ...
  }
  ```

4. run migration on your sqlite dev database:
  ```
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init --preview-feature
  ```


You could install Prisma [Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio/releases) to view your data, comes very handy for sqlite.

PrismaClient is created in **prisma.js** under the libs top-level directory. This instance is shared across the API routes.

```js filename=prisma.js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
export default prisma;
```

To retrive list of notes ordered by its id descending:

```js filename=index.js
const notes = await prisma.note.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      id: 'desc',
    },
  ],
})
```

To create a new note:

```js filename=index.js
const newNote = await prisma.note.create({
  data: {
    title: (req.body.title || '').slice(0, 255),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    body: (req.body.body || '').slice(0, 2048),
    created_by: login,
  },
})
```

You can find the source code for this project in [github](https://github.com/aruld/server-components-next-sqlite).

### Notes

*  To use the authentication component in this demo, you need to create an Github [OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) and configure the secrets in **.env** file in the root of the project.
  ```properties filename=.env
  ENDPOINT='http://localhost:3000'
  SESSION_KEY='<random key for cookie-based session>'
  OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY='github oauth app id'
  OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='github oauth app secret'
  ```
* It works with Node.js versions 14 LTS, not the latest 15. There is an open [issue](https://github.com/vercel/next-server-components/issues/2) regarding this.
* You cannot host this app in [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as they do not support [SQLite](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/4443) which stores data locally.
